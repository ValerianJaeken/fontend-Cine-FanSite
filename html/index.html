        <p class="card-text">
          Born the second son of wealthy landowners John and Elizabeth Howlett in Alberta, Canada during the late 19th Century, James Howlett was a frail boy of poor health. James was largely neglected by his mother, who was institutionalized for a time following
          the death of her first son, John Jr., in 1897. He spent most of his early years on the estate grounds and had two playmates that lived on the Howlett estate with him: Rose, a red-headed girl who was brought in from town to be a companion to
          young James, and a boy nicknamed "Dog" who was the son of the groundskeeper, Thomas Logan. Thomas Logan was an alcoholic and was extremely abusive to his son. The children were close friends but as they reached young adulthood, the abuse inflicted
          upon Dog warped his mind. His actions would lead to a <b>tragic chain of events.</b> that started as the three neared their adolescent years when Dog made unwanted advances toward Rose and James reported it to his father. In retaliation
          Dog killed James's pet dog. This in turn resulted in the expulsion of Thomas Logan and Dog Logan from the estate.
        </p>

        <p class="card-text">
          Thomas Logan, in a drunken stupor, invaded the Howlett estate with his son and attempted to take Elizabeth Howlett (implied to be his former lover) with him. John attempted to stop him and Thomas Logan shot him down in cold blood. James Howlett had just
          entered the room when this occurred and for the first time his mutation manifested; his claws extended from the backs of his hands and <b>he attacked the intruders with uncharacteristic ferocity, killing Thomas Logan, and scarring Dog's face</b>          with three claw marks. Elizabeth Howlett, who was already an emotionally disturbed woman, took her life immediately afterward with a blast from Thomas's gun. Fearing for their safety, Rose fled the estate with James, who appeared to have been
          deeply traumatized and had somehow repressed or forgotten most of the memories of life back at the estate. Dog falsely reported to the police and James's grandfather that Rose had murdered John Howlett II and Thomas Logan. The eldest Howlett,
          shunned James and with no family left, took Dog in as his ward. However,<b> Dog was already a burgeoning psychopath and it was too late for his character to evolve down any other path.</b>
        </p>

        <p class="card-text">
          In the years that followed, James and Rose took refuge in a British Colombia mining colony under the guise of being cousins. James also assumed the name of "Logan" in order to hide his identity. As the hard work of mining toughened his body, and his mutant
          powers developed, he grew to be unusually strong and ferocious. <b>He was immune to the elements and even ran with the wolves in the forest, learning to hunt as an animal hunts.</b> "Logan" became a valuable and admirable figure amongst
          the small community of miners due to his hard work and strong ethics, earning him the respect of his peers, including the foreman Smitty, who became a surrogate father figure to James. During this period, James developed strong feelings for
          Rose, but could not act on them for the sake of their guise as cousins. Smitty, who had been mentoring James all these years, had also grown close to Rose, and the two eventually fell in love and became engaged, much to the scorn and surprise
          of James, who later accepted the situation for the sake of Rose's happiness. Meanwhile, the elder John Howlett was in failing health and asked Dog to find Rose and his grandson so he could make peace with them before he died. Dog agreed. However,
          Dog (who has become a physically formidable man himself) decides to track them down so he can kill James.
        </p>
        <img class="card-img" src="https://img00.deviantart.net/5907/i/2013/231/b/0/rides_with_wolves_by_superpael-d6itkhm.jpg" alt="Card image cap">
        <p class="card-text">
          Dog hunted James and Rose down so easily that it seemed he had a preternatural skill for tracking. On then night that Smitty was due to leave the mining town with Rose, Dog (who bears an uncanny resemblance to Logan's future nemesis, Sabretooth) finally
          found and confronted James. Dog reminded James of his past, and that faithful night back on the estate that had changed all their lives so. The two fiercely fought in the middle of the street and despite being the physically stronger of the
          two Dog was eventually overpowered by the enraged James. As Dog laid unconscious, James unsheathed his claws for the first time in public, to the shock of everyone watching, and was about to deal the deathblow until <b>Rose leapt in to stop him
          but was accidentally was impaled by his claws.</b> Horrified, "Logan" held her in his arms as she died. He then fled into the woods where he lived in self-imposed exile with a pack of wolves, presumably for many years.

        <p class="card-text">
          Logan possesses memories of being a Samurai in Japan, a mercenary operative for the Central Intelligence Agency, and a "wild man" in the Canadian wilderness. Due to extensive memory implants given to Logan through the Weapon X program, any or all of these
          memories are suspect. Logan has at least one memory of meeting Captain America (Steve Rogers) in World War II while he was in the Canadian Army which has been verified as true. Sometime after World War II, Logan was taken by a group of scientists
          led by Dr. Cornelius as part of the Weapon X program. Cornelius was hired to perfect and use a technique that would bond the indestructible element adamantium to human bone cells. Logan's skeleton was bonded to the adamantium, and he was <b>indoctrinated
          into the Weapon X assassin program.</b>
        </p>

        <p class="card-text">
          Wolverine was conscripted by Department H, and for his first mission was sent against the incredible Hulk. Wolverine was subsequently approached by Professor Charles Xavier, who was looking for mutants to help his students, the X-Men, escape from the
          island-being known as Krakoa, which had captured them. Wolverine left Alpha Flight to accompany Xavier and rescue the captured X-Men. After Krakoa was defeated, Wolverine decided to stay with the X-Men, <b>for reasons which included that he had
          fallen for Marvel Girl (Jean Grey)</b>. Logan remained with the X-Men for quite some time, at one time being their field commander, and encountered adversaries such as Proteus (Kevin MacTaggart), Magneto (Magnus), the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants,
          the Brood, the Reavers, demons from the dimension of Limbo, the Marauders, the Morlocks, and even Dracula on one occasion.

        <p class="card-text">
          After his encounter with the mutant assassin Omega Red, Logan began to question the memories he possessed, but his searches to find his true identity and memories proved fruitless. During an encounter with the mutant Magneto on his space station called
          Avalon, Wolverine slashed Magneto with his claws. Magneto retaliated, <b>using his powers of the magnetic field to tear the adamantium out of Wolverine's skeleton</b>, causing extensive injuries. These injuries shorted out Wolverine's
          healing factor for a time, and Logan also discovered that the claws that he believed a result of the Weapon X project were in fact part of his actual bone structure due to his mutation. These bone claws became Wolverine's main weapons until
          his skeleton later became grafted to adamantium again.
        </p>
        <img class="card-img" src="http://overmental.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/wolverine-magneto-25241.jpg" alt="Card image cap">
        <p class="card-text">
          As a result of his injuries, Logan left the X-Men for a time. He visited Muir Island at the request of Kitty Pryde, and was also attacked by Cyber. During the Phalanx invasion, Logan and Cable were asked by Charles Xavier to find and rescue the captured
          X-Men. They joined with Cyclops (Scott Summers) and Jean Grey returning from their honeymoon (and secretly the future) and freed their teammates in Tibet. Later, Logan was kidnapped by Tyler Dayspring, calling himself Genesis, who wanted to
          make Wolverine one of his new Horsemen. Genesis had acquired adamantium by destroying the body of the mercenary known as Cyber, and had planned to recreate the bonding process used on Logan years ago. This time, however, Logan's body rejected
          the adamantium, and <b>he regressed for a time to a feral-like state.</b>
        </p>

        <p class="card-text">
          Logan regained his lucidity and rejoined the X-Men. Logan was subsequently kidnapped by the would-be conqueror Apocalypse (En Sabah Nur) and forced to fight the savage assassin Sabretooth for the mantle of the Horseman Death. Knowing that he might be
          able to resist Apocalypse's programming and that Sabretooth would be a very dangerous villain with the support of Apocalypse, Logan fought and defeated his nemesis. As a result, his skeleton again was laced with Adamantium. <b>Under the control
          of Apocalypse, Wolverine fought the X-Men ferociously in his Death persona.</b> But with the help of his teammates, he eventually broke free from Apocalypse's control.

        <p class="card-text">
          While on the Weapon Plus satellite, Logan was able to access detailed files on his past. However, it was a trap, and only Jean's manifestation of the Phoenix was able to save them. <b>Wolverine greatly mourns Jean's loss</b>, was not pleased
          with Cyclops and Emma Frost's relationship, but has remained a valued member of the X-Men, serving on as many missions as he can while also doing solo operations.

          Wolverine was ambushed by the Hand and Hydra. Transformed into a killing machine and outfitted with several devices, he battled various other heroes and killed both Hornet and Northstar. S.H.I.E.L.D. was eventually able to deprogram Logan, and he was
          sent to oppose Northstar, who also had been resurrected by Hydra. While on a mission in the Savage Land, he met the recently reformed Avengers and eventually accepted membership. Recently, Wolverine unnerved many high level officials, including
          those of S.H.I.E.L.D., by his sporadic movements in and out of the grid, with the tensions mounting in what seemed to be Wolverine's attempted assassination of the prime minister of Japan. Eventually it was revealed that Wolverine's true target
          was not the prime minister, but his bodyguard, the Silver Samurai. During an interrogation that began during their battle, and ended shortly after Logan severed the samurai's arm, Wolverine received some more information that led him back to
          Department H. Despite what he had originally thought, it was not the carelessness of his captors that allowed him to escape; rather, the Winter Soldier seemingly interfered with the operation in such a way that allowed Logan's escape. Wolverine
          tracked down the Winter Soldier in Serbia for information, but was rendered unconscious after a struggle after which the Winter Soldier revealed that he had earlier murdered Logan's pregnant wife.

            fun. It’s a popcorn movie portrayed through comic books.</p>

            and the Spider-Mobile at his side (and a symbiote empowered T-Rex on this tail!), Logan clings to whatever humanity he has left in the face of tragedy. His quest to avenge his family after they’ve met their ends at the hands of the Hulk’s
            incestuous family is over the top and intense but falls very in line with the tenets that informed the character from the beginning. </p>

          <p class="card-text">Enter Barry Windsor-Smith with an intense examination of what and who made Wolverine the man that fans had come to know and love. Wolverine’s dark past had been hinted at before but the torturous methods of the Weapon X program make it clear
            that Logan has been through the wringer in his life. Windsor-Smith doesn’t shy away from depicting the program’s relentless abuse of possibly the one of the only men who could take it, creating a near perfect killing machine except for one
            detail - underneath it all, he’s still human.
            <br>Windsor-Smith added a new layer to the Wolverine mythos - one that has since been expanded by other writers and allowed for the creation of many other fan-favorites namely, Fantomex and the killer currently under the Wolverine cowl, Laura
            Kinney a.k.a. X-23. </p>

          <p class="card-text">"Fatal Attractions" was kind of created by accident with Peter David admitting that he tossed out the concept of Magneto removing Wolverine’s adamantium as a joke. But if there was any time to tell this story, the 90s were it.
            <br> It’s excessive and over-the-top but it’s uniquely a Wolverine story. He’s a character who can be put through a lot of abuse because of his healing factor and that leaves a lot of room for deep explorations of trauma and survival. Plus
            the image of Magneto pulling the metal through his pores became one of the most memorable in this history. The arc introduced some new ideas, namely that Wolverine’s claws are actually bone underneath, adding another wrinkle to Logan’s mutation
            that hadn’t been previously known. </p>
